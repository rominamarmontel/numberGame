## Introduction
This is my first project with Javascript, CSS and HTML in Ironhack School.<br>
I chose NUMBER PUSHING GAME for understanding the Class and DOM operation.<br>

### Technology

## Features

    - [Classes] : You can find just the product you are looking for by entering keywords
                        into a search engine. However, at this time, only one keyword is supported, and we plan to
                        improve this functionality with additional features.
    - [DOM operation]    : Products and Topics can be edited, deleted, and new ones added from the Admin Panel.
    - [Counting Score]    : You can add products to your cart by specifying the quantity you wish to purchase.
                        The inventory count is also automatically updated with sales records, so you can immediately see
                        if an item is available for purchase or not.
    - [intervalId/clearInterval]         : This option is available only to registered users. Submissions are limited to one
                        per product, and the number of stars is automatically calculated and changed according to the user's rating.
    - [Modal]         : This option is available only to registered users. Submissions are limited to one
                        per product, and the number of stars is automatically calculated and changed according to the user's rating.
